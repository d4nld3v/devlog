Hey! I’m a junior developer working in frontend who’s always exploring new languages, frameworks, and ways of doing things. I like building my own tools, websites, and apps—mostly for fun, though they sometimes turn out to be pretty useful.

This blog is my little corner to share what I’m learning and the experiments I feel like doing. If you enjoy tinkering with code, you’ll probably feel right at home here.
