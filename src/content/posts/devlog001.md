## Why I Created This Blog

This blog was born from a simple idea: to store and document my experience while building web projects — challenges, experiments, lessons learned, and everything in between.

I see it as both a personal and technical space. A place to revisit things I’ve built or solved, share insights that might help others, and show how I think and work. It also adds value on the professional side — it helps me stand out by demonstrating not just what I do, but how I approach and document the process.

My goal with this blog is to keep things as simple as possible. I’m not here to write deep-dive technical essays or reinvent Medium. Just short, honest posts about what I’m working on. Minimal effort, maximum value (or at least that's the dream).

And hey — if nothing else, future me will have a nice time capsule of confusion and progress. Hello, future me. Hope you figured out that one weird bug.

## Built with Astro (and a Template)

To build this blog, I used a template called [multiterm-astro](https://github.com/stelcodes/multiterm-astro). It came well-structured, supports Markdown out of the box, and has a clean design. I only changed the theme and added my personal configuration. I didn’t want to overcomplicate things — my main goal was to start writing as soon as possible.

No CSS deep dives. No JS frameworks inside frameworks. Just Markdown, config files, and a few late nights wondering if this font looks too serious.

## Why Astro?

I chose Astro because it fits exactly what I was looking for. It’s fast and optimized for static content, minimalistic, and easy to maintain. It supports Markdown natively and focuses on content. I don’t need animations or images — my goal is to write the old-school way, using plain text to avoid visual noise.

Astro lets me write like it’s 1999 — but with better DX.

## What’s Next

This blog will be part of my workflow. Everything I experience while creating websites, apps, or trying out new technologies will be documented here.

If I break something, I’ll write about it. If I fix something, I’ll write about that too. If I have no idea what’s going on — well, that’s probably going in here as well.
